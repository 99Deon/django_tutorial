**Project: ia news Blog**

**Description:**
Create a personal blog where you can write and publish articles. The blog should have the following features:

1. **User Authentication:** Allow users to register, log in, and log out. Only logged-in users should be able to create, edit, and delete their blog posts.

2. **Blog Posts:** Each blog post should have a title, content, publication date, and an author. Users should be able to create, edit, and delete their own blog posts.

3. **Comments:** Allow users to comment on blog posts. Comments should be approved by the author before being displayed on the blog post.

4. **Search:** Implement a search functionality to allow users to search for blog posts based on keywords.

5. **Responsive Design:** Make sure the blog is responsive and looks good on different devices.

This project will help you practice working with Django's models, views, templates, forms, and authentication system.
